# Shuffling in (Music Player Name)
Shuffling 

# Factors
The main factor I'm planning to use in the "shuffling" of songs is genres, and somewhat artists too. 
I want to have a similar shuffle mode, where similar songs are played to what is started when playing. 
This will probably require real time shuffling though, which is a bit weird but eh.
(I've decided to call it a radio system, inline with what most music streaming sites do and lets me have a reason behind only having a single up next).

# Weighted Random
As this is going to be working with a lot of weights, I want it to be as efficient as possible. An efficient way of doing weighted randoms is the Walker Alias method.
