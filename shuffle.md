Shuffling 

# Factors
The main factor I'm planning to use in the "shuffling" of songs is genres, and somewhat artists too. 
I want to have a similar shuffle mode, where similar songs are played to what is started when playing. 
This will probably require real time shuffling though, which is a bit weird but eh.
